                                    Your goal is to draw cards with
                                    a
                                    value

                                    <strong>close to 21</strong>
                                    as possible without going over. A hand that <strong>goes over 21</strong> is a
                                    <strong>bust</strong> or <strong>break</strong>
                                    . The players at a
                                    blackjack

                                    not play against each other, they play against the dealer. Each player only has to
                                    beat the
                                    dealer's
                                    hand to
                                    Win.
                                    You do this in one of two ways:

        <h2> At the conclusion of each round of play, the dealer will collect all losing wagers and pay off all winning
            wagers.</h2>
        <h2>All winning wagers are paid 1 to 1 with the exception of Blackjack which is paid at 3 to 2 or 6 to 5. The
            payoff
            odds for a blackjack will be clearly printed on each table game layout. Example it might say "Blackjack pays
            3:2."</h2>
        <h2>Numbered Cards</h2>
        <h2>Cards numbered 2 - 10 are worth their face value.</h2>
        <h2>Face Cards</h2>
        <h2>Face Cards (Kings, Queens & Jacks) are worth 10 points each.</h2>
        <h2>Aces</h2>
        <h2>The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 (whichever is more beneficial for your hand)</h2>

        <h1> Bust </h1>
        <h2> In Blackjack, the hand with the highest total wins as long as it doesn't exceed 21. A hand with a value
            over 21 is
            called a "Bust” or "Break" and it is an automatic loser.</h2>
        <h1> Soft & Hard </h1>
        <h2>A hand in which an Ace's value is counted as 11 is called a Soft hand, because it cannot be busted if the
            player
            draws another card. When an ace is counted as one point, this is called a Hard hand.</h2>
        <h2> If the table is designated a must-hit-soft-17 Blackjack game, the dealer must draw on all soft 17 hands
            until he or
            she obtains a point total of a hard 17 or higher.</h2>
        <h2>But here we use the soft 17</h2>

        <h1>BlackJack</h1>
        <h2>he best possible hand in Blackjack is a combination of an Ace with a 10-card or a face card. This is an
            automatic
            21, when counting the Ace as an 11, and is called, "Blackjack", or a Natural. It cannot be beaten, unless
            the dealer
            has the same, which would be a Push, a tie. In a push, the player receives the bet back.</h2>

        <h1>Stand</h1>
        <h2>When you Stand in Blackjack, your intention is to "stay" with the original two cards you have been dealt,
            and don’t
            need another card for the current hand in progress.</h2>
        <h3> Blackjack hand gestures:</h3>
        <h4>"STAND" - To indicate this, you simply extend your palm over the cards, and slightly wave your hand from
            side-to-side. This indicates to the dealer that you are satisfied with the cards you already have, and do
            not wish
            to do anything else. The dealer will then move on to the next player, in turn.</h4>
        <h1>Hit</h1>
        <h2>"Hit" is your intention is to "draw more cards". You "Hit" when you feel your hand is not close enough to 21
            and you
            need to draw additional cards.</h2>

        <h3> Blackjack hand gestures:</h3>
        <h4>"HIT" - If you’re holding your cards, simply scrape your cards on the table gently to ask for another card.
            If your
            cards are face-up, you can either touch your finger on the table or use your hand to wave towards yourself.
            This
            indicates to the dealer that you want another card, and he or she will then deal you one card from the shoe,
            face
            up, and place it next to your original two cards. You now have to make a decision, on whether to "Stand" or
            "Hit
            again".</h4>
        <h1>Double-Down</h1>
        <h2>After receiving your first two cards, or on the first two cards of any split pair, you may "double down" if
            you have
            two cards whose total value can be much improved by just one good hit (usually cards whose initial combined
            value is
            either "10” or "11”).</h2>
        <h3> Blackjack hand gestures:</h3>
        <h4>"DOUBLE DOWN" - The way to signal that you want to "double down" is to place the extra chips next to your
            initial
            bet or simply say to the dealer: "Double-Down, please". When you say this, the dealer will then ask you to
            place an
            additional wager, equivalent to the amount of your original bet next to that original bet, and then deal you
            one
            additional card.</h4>

        <h1>Splitting Pairs</h1>
        <h2>If your first two cards are of equal value, you have the option of "splitting" them into two separate hands.
            For
            example, two Aces – you can "split" them into two separate hands, and play them both for the round.</h2>
        <h3> Blackjack hand gestures:</h3>
        <h4>"SPLIT PAIRS" - If you would like to split two same-value cards, all you have to do is place another bet
            with the
            same value, but put your chips down in an area away from the original betting box and hold up your index and
            middle
            finger.</h4>

        <h1>Blackjack Outcomes</h1>
        <h2>Bust</h2>
        <p>You "Bust" in Blackjack when you draw more cards to your hand (by asking to "hit”) and the combined total
            value
            exceeds "21”. When you "Bust", you lose your wager and that round is over for you.</p>
        <h2>Push</h2>
        <p>A "push" happens when both you and the dealer have the SAME total value of all cards. For example, if your
            total is,
            say, 18, and the dealer has the same total of 18, then neither you nor the dealer win or lose. It’s a
            "push”, a sort
            of "stand-off” where you don’t lose, and don’t win, and neither does the dealer. If you "push” ANY hand, you
            can
            either leave the same wager for the next hand, or change the amount of that wager for the next hand, or
            remove all
            your wagers altogether, and even leave the game.</p>
        <h2>Insurance</h2>
        <p>Insurance is a side bet protecting you against the possibility that the dealer has a blackjack. If the
            dealer's "up
            card" is an Ace, you may make an additional wager known as Insurance. You can bet only half your original
            bet. If
            the dealer does have a Blackjack, your original bet loses and the insurance is paid 2 to 1. If the dealer
            doesn't
            have a Blackjack, he takes the insurance bet and the game continues as normal.</p>
        <h2>Surrender</h2>
        <p>In Blackjack, players have the option of surrendering one half of their original wager after receiving their
            first
            two cards. If you surrender your cards, the dealer will take half of your wager. (Note: the Surrender option
            is not
            available on the Double Deck game.)</p>
